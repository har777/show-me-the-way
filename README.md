===============

See OSM edits happen in real time.

This code is deployed and running here:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/

You can restrict it to viewing only edits within a specified bounding-box like so:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/#bbox=32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65

Get bounding box values like that, using this page:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/bbox.html

You can restrict it to viewing only edits by particular users like so:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/#users=har777,geohacker

You can restrict it to viewing only edits containing comments containing a particular string like this:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/#comments=residential

You can change the speed of the edits like:
http://har777.github.io/show-me-the-way/#speed=700

Any of the above can be combined using '&'
